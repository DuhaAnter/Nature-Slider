# Nature slider 
a simple responsive landing page I deveolped using **HTML**,**CSS**,**JS**.		  

I used:   

_Media Query_ to make it responsive.  

_Js_ to handle click events and the hamburger menu.   

_FontAwesome_ for different icons.   

_Animations_ to make the page more engaging and visually appealing.
